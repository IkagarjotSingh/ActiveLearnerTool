3398,satellite and cellular communication options;the satellite communication module should be relatively easy for a field technician to install that way we can easily sell the cellular version to customers and tell them that if that’s not good enough they can always upgrade without shipping back their device,messages;like the g7 the transportable should be able to receive messages from the server and send pre-canned and custom messages the way the g7 does from the configuration profile we want the ability to toggle-off or disable the ability to send messages from the transportable (we would like this functionality for the g7 as well but that’s a separate consideration) messaging would be available over cellular and satellite,0,0,A,A

2147,calibration and bump test;we would have to have a way to inform any users that a bump or cal is occurring and they are not being monitored the indicator has to be local at the device (for example: sound/yellow blue light) and this will reflect on the portal at the beginning and the end of bump/cal (mode change,pump module; if multiple inlets are used for sampling we’ll need to set the sample interval since we can’t draw on more than one at a time,0,0,A,A
